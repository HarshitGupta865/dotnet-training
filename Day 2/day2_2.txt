Abstract Class : 
_________________

A class, that which can be created, but not implemented and instantiated konwn as abstract class. Abstract class contains both abstrat and non-abstract methods, 
abstract methods needs to be overrided mandetorily by the derived class.

abstract class class_name
{
   abstract method1();
   abstract method2();
}

You cannot create an object to abstract class. 

Will Abstract Class Contains Constructors ???

interfaces :

C# Does not support the concept of multiple inheritance, to achieve this we need the help of interfaces. 

An interface contains method declaration and the implementation can be done in the corresponding class, 
you can add more than one interface to the particular class. 

Difference betwen interface and abstract class
________________________________________________

An abstract class contains both abstract/non-abstract methods, where interface contains only abstract methods

Interface methods are public and abstract by default.

Multiple inheritance can be achieved by using interfaces

An interface can be called from anywhere to anywhere
